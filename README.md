# Cloud-based-PE-Malware-Detection-API

## Introduction

The main objective of this project is to train a machine learning model to detect whether the given PE is malware or benign. The project is divided into three tasks. Firstly training a model, deploying it on cloud and generating an api and lastly using that api to classify any given PE file as malware or benign or display the probabilities.

For the dataset we will be using the EMBER-2017 v2 dataset. Link for the dataset is: (https://github.com/endgameinc/ember).
The detailed instructions to work on this project are in the project_instructions file.

## Implementation
### Task1: Training the model
This task starts with data loading and preprocessing. I extracted an ember dataset and after that cloned the github for vectorizing and feature extraction. Then, using Keras, a deep neural network architecture is created and the model is trained, validated, and tested.

### Task2: Deploy the model on the cloud
I used Amazon Sagemaker to deploy the model to the cloud and to construct an endpoint (API).

### Task3: Create a client
Built Python code that reads a PE file, converts it to a feature vector and runs the vector on the cloud API to test and publish the results.Â
